    <h1>Chapter One</h1>
    <h2>An Introduction</h2>
    <p>Hello and welcome to my blog website, the following chapter will depict an introduction into my love of
        Spring and set the groundwork for the following paragraphs, my name is Ian Carpendale, I feel like Spring is
        the best season of the year, hopefully when you have read my chapters on this topic you will feel the same,
        that is my ultimate goal of this assignment is to try and persuade you, the reader that it is infact greatest
        time of the year.
    </p>

    <h2>The reasoning</h2>
    <p>There are many reasons why Spring is my favourite time of the year, for a start we are transitioning from a very cold,
        miserable time of year, during the winter period it is very very cold, dark and overall a dreary time,
        there is not much nature and wildlife, the lack of wildlife during winter is shocking, animals often
        hibernate for the winter time, and I feel the absence of wildlife can have a negative impact on the surrounding
        areas around you, I feel happier when I can hear the birds chirping, the animals out in abundance and enjoying
        the good weather we have.
    </p>

    <h2>The Surrounding area</h2>
    <p>Coming from winter into Spring we can see a number of things come into full circle, we receive longer days,
        the sun stays out for longer, meaning we can spend more time outdoors enjoying ourselves instead of being
        stuck inside for most of the day hugging radiators and bundling ourselves up with many layers of clothing,
        the heat and sun has also been proven to raise peoples happiness levels from many online studies, we get our
        correct levels of vitamin D and as a result we are content.
    </p>

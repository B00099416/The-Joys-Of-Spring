    <h1>Chapter Two</h1>
    <h2>My Experiences</h2>
    <p>In this section of my entries I will link my past experiences with my love of Spring, there is a
    psychological reason why I associate  Spring to be a happy and enjoyable time, not only for the reasons that
    are apparent such as nature, the longer days, the animals that are associated with Spring. There are many of these
    reasons the normal person would link with Spring, but in the following paragraphs we will go into details
    about the psychological reasons.</p>

    <h2>The Psychological aspect</h2>
    <p>In my life I have had a number of experiences with Spring that have triggered my association with
        Spring to be a positive one, from and early age, I have great memories of trips to the local park, staying
        out later with friends and playing sports, and every Spring I found myself to gather more and more memories
        as the years went on, each year I would spend my time outdoors in the fresh air enjoying activities and
        getting into a number of sporting activities, mainly athletics where I have competed in a number of competitions,
        in the winter months I would train indoors in anticipation of being able to train outdoors.
    </p>

    <h2>Friends & Family</h2>
    <p>There's something special about Spring time in relation to your friends and family, people seem to gather more
        and come together more, in my family and friends  have a number of birthdays in Spring time so I have always
        linked this time with a time to be with friends and family, there is a lot of events that happen so this also
        adds to the number of reasons that I enjoy this time of year, it really is a fantastic time.
    </p>

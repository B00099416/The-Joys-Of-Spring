    <h1>Chapter Three</h1>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>By now I hope I have been able to convince you that Spring is the greatest season of them all,
        I wish to discuss what we have talked about so far and summarise by points of this amazing time It is indeed
        a time to rejoice, be with new and old friends, a coming together of people and events in a setting that
        depicts an abundance of nature and wildlife, longer and sunnier days, a time where cold drinks are most
        appreciated, friendships are made and memories are made.
    </p>

    <h2>Discussing The Previous Topics</h2>
    <p>In Chapter 01 we began to introduce the idea that Spring is the best time, we were shown a slight insight into
        the reasoning behind this and what factors constitutes the idea that that Spring is the best time. We talked
        about how the abundance of nature, how the days get longer the intake in vitamin D helps boost our mood,
        the sun begins to become stronger.
    </p>

    <h2>The End</h2>
    <p>I Hope you have enjoyed listening to what I have had to say about Springtime and I wish that you also
        will agree that it is the best time of the year and that many contributing factors are included in
        examining that it should also be your own favourite time of year, I wish you a great coming Spring full of
        memories and good times in the sun with friends and family, bye!
    </p>
